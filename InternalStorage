To create and write a private file to the internal storage:

1. Call openFileOutput() with the name of the file and the operating mode. This returns a FileOutputStream.
2. Write to the file with write().
3. Close the stream with close().

For example:

String FILENAME = "hello_file";
String string = "hello world!";

FileOutputStream fos = openFileOutput(FILENAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
fos.write(string.getBytes());
fos.close();

To read a file from internal storage:

1. Call openFileInput() and pass it the name of the file to read. This returns a FileInputStream.
2. Read bytes from the file with read().
3. Then close the stream with close().

FileInputStream fin = openFileInput(file);
int c;
String temp="";
while( (c = fin.read()) != -1){
   temp = temp + Character.toString((char)c);
}
//string temp contains all the data of the file.
fin.close();

Other useful methods:

getFilesDir()
Gets the absolute path to the filesystem directory where your internal files are saved.

getDir()
Creates (or opens an existing) directory within your internal storage space.

deleteFile()
Deletes a file saved on the internal storage.

fileList()
Returns an array of files currently saved by your application.
